Week 1 – Core Java & OOP

Goal: Learn Java basics and object-oriented programming.

Day	Task
Mon	Install JDK & IDE. Write first “Hello World” program. Review Java syntax.
Tue	Learn variables, data types, operators. Write simple exercises (e.g., calculate number of books).
Wed	Control structures: if/else, switch, loops. Practice with scenarios like “borrow books if available.”
Thu	Methods/functions: parameters, return values. Create methods like borrowBook(), returnBook().
Fri	Classes and objects: create classes Book, Member. Add attributes and methods.
Sat	Encapsulation: make fields private, use getters/setters. Implement borrow/return logic.
Sun	Inheritance & Polymorphism: create subclasses like EBook and PrintedBook extending Book. Override methods.
Week 2 – Collections, Exceptions, and File I/O

Goal: Handle data collections, exceptions, and files.

Day	Task
Mon	Learn ArrayList, HashMap, Set. Store books and members.
Tue	Exceptions: try/catch/finally. Handle cases like “book not found.”
Wed	Custom exceptions: create BookNotAvailableException. Throw it when needed.
Thu	File I/O: save and load library data to text files using FileReader/FileWriter.
Fri	Practice: Library Management System – add, remove, list books and members.
Sat	Extend: persist borrowed books info to file and load on start.
Sun	Review Week 1 & 2 concepts: redo exercises, fix bugs, clean code.
Week 3 – SQL & Frameworks (Spring Boot + Hibernate/JPA)

Goal: Connect Java apps to database and perform CRUD operations.

Day	Task
Mon	Install MySQL. Learn basic SQL: CREATE TABLE for Book and Member.
Tue	SQL queries: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT. Practice with library data.
Wed	JDBC basics: connect Java app to database, perform SELECT queries.
Thu	Hibernate/JPA: create Book and Member entities. Map to database tables.
Fri	Spring Boot: set up project. Build REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for books/members.
Sat	Implement borrowing and returning books via REST API.
Sun	Combine Hibernate/JPA with Spring Boot for full CRUD functionality.
Week 4 – Web Basics & Full-Stack Practice

Goal: Build a small full-stack Java web application.

Day	Task
Mon	HTML5: create simple page for library (list books, add new book).
Tue	CSS3: style the page, layout, colors, fonts.
Wed	JavaScript: add interactivity (borrow/return books dynamically).
Thu	Integrate front-end with Spring Boot REST API: display books and members dynamically.
Fri	Deploy app locally on Apache Tomcat: package as WAR, run server, access in browser.
Sat	Test CRUD operations and UI interactions. Fix bugs and refine UI.
Sun	Review entire 4-week program: redo exercises, push projects to GitHub.
